# Lorentz-Attractor
In this Repo have all detalisl analysis about well known nonlinear system called LORENTZ SYSTEM.

## Equations
The Lorenz system is governed by the following equations:

with parameters

- σ (sigma) = 10
- ρ (rho) = 28
- β (beta) = 8/3

## Plot

Here is a sample trajectory of the Lorenz attractor:

## Lorenz System

The Lorenz system is defined as:

    dx/dt = sigma * (y - x)
    dy/dt = x * (rho - z) - y
    dz/dt = x * y - beta * z

Using the classic parameters:

    sigma = 10
    rho   = 28
    beta  = 8/3


## Lorenz System (σ = 10, ρ = 28, β = 8⁄3)

The system is given by:

  dx⁄dt = σ (y − x)  
  dy⁄dt = x (ρ − z) − y  
  dz⁄dt = x·y − β·z
